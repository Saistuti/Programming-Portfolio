# Week 2 – Variables, Data Types, Strings, and Lists in Python

## Activities I Did
- Practiced creating variables and assigning values of different types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`).  
- Experimented with updating variable values using normal and augmented assignment (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`).  
- Used `print()` to display values, including combining multiple arguments.  
- Learned to take user input with `input()` and convert data types using `int()` and `float()`.  
- Manipulated strings: indexing, slicing, negative indexing, and escape sequences.  
- Practiced working with lists: creating, indexing, slicing, mutating with assignment, `append()`, and augmented assignment.  
- Calculated lengths of strings and lists using `len()`.

## Summary of Week 2 Lecture
This week focused on working with **variables**, **data types**, **strings**, and **lists** in Python. We learned how to store values in variables and how to update them using standard or augmented assignment. Python’s dynamic typing allows variables to hold different data types over time, but this can cause runtime errors if not handled carefully. Strings were introduced as immutable sequences, with features such as indexing, negative indexing, slicing, and escape sequences. Lists were presented as mutable sequences that can be changed in place, supporting operations like concatenation, slicing, and appending. We also explored functions like `print()`, `type()`, and `len()`, as well as taking input from users and converting it to the correct type. The lecture emphasized understanding the difference between mutable and immutable types and hands-on practice with sequence operations.

## Key Technologies Learned
- Python variables and data types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`)  
- Variable assignment and augmented assignment (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.)  
- Python functions: `print()`, `input()`, `type()`, `len()`  
- String operations: indexing, slicing, concatenation, repetition, escape sequences, triple quotes  
- List operations: indexing, slicing, concatenation, mutation (`append()`, augmented assignment), insertion, removal  
- Mutable vs immutable types: lists vs strings  

## Extra Notes
- Remember that the `=` operator **assigns a value**; it does not test equality. Use `==` for comparison.  
- Strings cannot be changed in-place; any modification creates a new string.  
- Lists are powerful because they can store mixed types and can be mutated easily.  
- `len()` is extremely useful for sequences and for ensuring indices are within range.  
- Escape sequences like `\n` and `\t` help format output cleanly.  
- Always convert user input to the correct type before using it in calculations.
