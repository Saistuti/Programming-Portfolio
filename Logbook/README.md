# Logbook

## Week 1:
Introduced programming basics and the role of programming languages. Covered program structure (input → processing → output), generations of languages, and Python as a beginner-friendly 3GL supporting multiple paradigms. Explored the Python interpreter, IDEs, expressions, operators, operator precedence, and common errors (syntax, logical). Focus was on understanding fundamentals and practicing basic Python coding.

## Week 2:
Focused on variables, data types, strings, and lists. Learned dynamic typing, updating variables, and type conversion. Strings were introduced with indexing, slicing, and immutability. Lists were shown as mutable sequences with operations like concatenation, slicing, and appending. Explored input/output functions and differences between mutable and immutable types.

## Week 3:
Introduced control flow with selection and iteration. Learned if, if-else, if-elif-else statements, Boolean expressions, logical operators, membership tests, and the ternary operator. Iteration covered while loops, for loops, range(), and control statements like break/continue. Emphasized writing clear, readable logic driven by conditions.

## Week 4:
Covered functions, including pre-defined and user-defined. Learned defining functions with def, using parameters, return values, and handling default, variable-length positional (*args) and keyword (**kwargs) arguments. Introduced lambda expressions for small, anonymous functions and discussed improving readability with docstrings and proper parameter handling.

## Week 5:
Focused on organizing Python code in scripts (.py) and modules for reusability. Learned running scripts with command-line arguments via sys.argv. Covered importing modules, selective imports, aliases, and Python’s search path (sys.path). Explained the use of __name__ to differentiate between script execution and module import.

## Week 6:
Explored compound sequences: lists and tuples. Lists are ordered and mutable with methods for adding, removing, sorting, and copying. Tuples are ordered and immutable, often storing heterogeneous values. Introduced list comprehensions for concise list creation and sequence unpacking with tuples for multiple assignments.

## Week 7:
Covered advanced collections: sets (unordered, unique, mutable) and dictionaries (key-value pairs, mutable, fast lookup). Compared with lists (ordered, mutable) and tuples (ordered, immutable). Learned comprehensions for sets and dictionaries. Key takeaway: choose collection types based on order, mutability, and element uniqueness.

## Week 8:
Introduced I/O operations and output formatting. Learned f-strings (modern, concise), str.format(), manual formatting (ljust(), rjust(), center(), zfill()), and %-style formatting. Emphasized professional output presentation. Covered file handling basics: reading, writing, and managing files in Python.
