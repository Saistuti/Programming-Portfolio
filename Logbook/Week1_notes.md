# Week 1 – Introduction to Programming and Python

## Activities I Did
- Explored Python using the command-line interpreter in interactive mode (REPL).  
- Practiced writing simple expressions like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and exponentiation.  
- Experimented with operator precedence and parentheses to see how expressions are evaluated.  
- Introduced myself to the Python Standard Library and learned about the concept of libraries.  
- Read error messages and practiced fixing syntax errors.

## Summary of Week 1 Lecture
This week we learned the basics of computer programming and the role of programming languages. We discussed what a computer program is, how it processes input and produces output, and the different generations of programming languages (from 1GL machine code to 4GL domain-specific languages). Python was introduced as a beginner-friendly 3GL language that supports multiple programming styles. We explored the Python interpreter, which allows interactive coding, and briefly looked at IDEs for future use. The lecture also covered Python expressions, operators, operator precedence, and common errors like syntax and logical errors. Overall, the focus was on understanding fundamental concepts and getting hands-on experience with Python.
