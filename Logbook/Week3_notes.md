# Week 3 – Control Flow: Boolean Expressions, Decisions, and Loops

## Activities I Did
- Practiced creating and evaluating **Boolean expressions** using relational operators (`<`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`, `>`).  
- Implemented decision-making using **if, if-else, and if-elif-else statements**.  
- Experimented with **logical operators** (`and`, `or`, `not`) and combined multiple conditions.  
- Tested **membership operators** (`in`, `not in`) with strings and lists.  
- Used **ternary operators** for concise conditional assignments.  
- Wrote **while loops** to repeat operations until a condition becomes false.  
- Wrote **for loops** to iterate over sequences, including using `range()` with start, stop, and step values.  
- Explored **break** and **continue** statements to control loop execution.  
- Implemented **nested loops** and nested conditional statements to understand multi-level logic.  

## Summary of Week 3 Lecture
This week focused on **control flow**, which allows us to implement the “logic” in programs beyond linear sequences. We learned that algorithms are built using **sequence, selection, and iteration**. Selection uses Boolean expressions in **if, if-else, and if-elif-else statements** to execute code conditionally. Boolean expressions can be combined with **logical operators** and membership tests for more complex conditions. The **ternary operator** was introduced as a concise way to return values based on a condition. Iteration allows repetition of code using **while loops** (condition-controlled) and **for loops** (sequence-controlled), including the use of `range()` for number sequences. Control statements can be **nested** for multi-level logic, and **break/continue** can alter the normal flow of loops. This week highlighted the importance of writing clear, readable logic and understanding how Boolean expressions drive program decisions.

## Key Technologies Learned
- Boolean expressions and relational operators: `<, <=, >, >=, ==, !=`  
- Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`  
- Membership operators: `in`, `not in`  
- Conditional statements: `if`, `if-else`, `if-elif-else`  
- Ternary operator syntax for concise conditional assignments  
- Iteration: `while` loops, `for` loops, and the `range()` function  
- Loop control: `break` and `continue`  
- Nested loops and nested control statements  
- Understanding sequence, selection, and iteration in algorithms  

## Extra Notes
- **Chaining relational operators** (e.g., `99 < x <= 1000`) can simplify conditions but may reduce readability.  
- **Parentheses are recommended** when combining multiple logical operators to avoid confusion.  
- Non-Boolean expressions in conditions are interpreted as `False` if 0 or empty, `True` otherwise.  
- Over-nesting loops and conditions can make code hard to read and affect performance; avoid deep nesting when possible.  
- The ternary operator is best for simple conditional assignments, not for executing complex blocks of code.  
- `for` loops are ideal for iterating over sequences like lists, while `while` loops are best for unknown numbers of iterations.
