# Programming-Portfolio

This repository contains my coursework portfolio for the Fundamentals of Computer Programming module. 
The repository is organised into the following main sections:

## Notebooks
The Notebooks folder contains weekly notebooks created during practical sessions and practical exercises. Each notebook includes Python code, explanations, and examples developed as part of the module's hands-on exercises.

## Logbook
The Logbook folder contains weekly learning notes based on lectures.
These notes are written in Markdown and reflect my own understanding of the topics covered each week. These includes: summaries of key programming concepts and personal reflections on what I learned.

## Project
The Project folder contains my main Python programming project for this module.
The folder includes: A README.md explaining what the program does and how to run it & a requirements.txt file( if any third-party libraries are required)
