## Week 2
This repositort contains solutions for four Python programming exercises. Each program demonstrates basic programming concepts such as input/output, arithmetic operations, conditional expressions, and formatted output.

# Program 1: Greeting the User
This program asks the user to enter their name and displays a friendly greeting message.

What it does:
- Prompts the user for their name
- Prints a personalized greeting using the entered name.

Python concepts used:
- input() function for getting user input.
- f-string for formatted output

# Program 2: Celsius to Fahrenheit Converter
This program converts a temperature given in Celsius to Fahrenheit.

What it does:
- Prompts the user to enter a temperature in Celsius.
- Converts it to Fahrenheit using the formula.
- Displays the converted temperature.

Python concepts used:
- float() to handle decimal numbers.
- Arithmetic operations (*,/,+)
- Formatted output using f-string.

# Program 3: Lab Group Calculator
This program calculates how many lab groups can be formed from a given number of students and a required group size.

What it does:
- Prompts the user for the total number of students and the desired group size.
- Uses integer division(//) to calculate full groups.
- Uses modulus(%) to find leftover students.

Python concepts used:
- int() to convert user input into integers.
- Integer division and modulus operations.
- Conditional expressions for proper grammar.
- Formatted output.

# Program 4: Sweet Distribution Calculator
This program helps a teacher distribute sweets evenly among pupils.

What it does:
- Prompts the user for the total number of sweets and pupils.
- Uses integer division to calculate how many sweets each pupil receives.
- Uses modulus to calculate leftover sweets.

Python concepts used:
- int() to handle integer input.
- Integer division(//) and modulus(%)
- Formatted output.
