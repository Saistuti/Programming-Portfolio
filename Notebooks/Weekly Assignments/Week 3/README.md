## Week 3
This repository contains a series of Python programs designed to practice user input handling, conditionals, loops, and basic arithmetic operations.

# Program 1: Greeting the User
This program asks the user to enter their name.
- If the user presses Enter without typing a name, it displays "Hello, Stranger!".
- Otherwise, it greets the user by name.

Python concepts used:
- input() function
- Conditional statements (if-else)
- Formatted strings(f-string)

# Progran 2: Password Confirmation
This program stimulates setting a password by asking the user to enter it twice.
- If both entries match, the password is accepted.
- If not, an error message is displayed.

Python concepts used:
- input() function
- Conditional statements(if-else)

# Program 3: Password Validation (Length)
This program checks that the password matches and meets length requirements (8–12 characters).

Python concepts used:
- len() function
- Conditional statements(if-else)

# Program 4: Password Validation (Common Passwords)
This program enhances security by preventing common passwords.
- Passwords must match
- Length must be 8–12 characters
- Password must not be a common password

Python concepts used:
- Lists
- in keyword for membership testing
- String methods (lower())
- Conditional statements

# Program 5: Password Loop Until Valid
This program keeps asking the user for a password until all validation rules are met.

Python concepts used:
- while True loop
- Input validation
- Conditional statements

# Program 6: Seven Times Table
This program prints the multiplication table of 7 from 0 to 12.

Python concepts used:
- for loop
- Formatted output

# Program 7: Multicaption Table for User Input
This program:
- Asks the user for a number between 0 and 12.
- Prints the multiplication table for that number.
- Displays an error if the number is outside the allowed range.

Python concepts used:
- input() and int()
- Conditional statements
- for loops

# Program 8: Multiplication Table with Negative Numbers
This program: 
- Prints a multiplication table for positive numbers (0–12).
- For negative numbers (-12 to -1), prints the table backwards using the absolute value.
- Displays an error for numbers outside the range -12 to 12.

Python concepts used:
- abs() function
- Conditional statements
- for loops with custom ranges
