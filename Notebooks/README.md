# Notebooks

## Weekly Assignments
This repository contains a collection of Python programs developed throughout Week 2, Week 3, Week 4, Week 5, Week 6, Week 7 and Week 8 of the Fundamentals of Computer Programming module.
The work demonstrates a progressive understanding of Python fundamentals, moving from basic input/output to functions, data structures, command-line arguments, and simple encryption techniques.

### Week 2 - Basic Input, Output and Conditionals
Topics Covered:
- User input with input()
- Formatted output
- Conditional statements (if, else)
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Simple validation logic

### Week 3 - Loops, Validation, and Repetition
Topics Covered:
- for and while loops
- Input validation
- Repetition until valid input
- Multiplication tables

### Week 4 - Functions, Strings, and Data Processing
Topics covered:
- Functions and return values
- String manipulation and formatting
- Input validation
- Lists, loops, and basic statistics

### Week 5: Command-Line Arguments and File Operations
Topics Covered:
- Using sys for command-line arguments and platform info
- URL requests and HTTP status checking
- Basic file operations and backups
- Lists, statistics, and data processing

### Week 6: Number Thory and Simple Encryption
Topics Covered:
- Binary conversion
- Finding factors of a number
- Prime number checking
- Basic string encryption and decryption
- Randomization for message hiding

### Week 7: Sets, Dictionaries, and Frequency Analysis
Topics Covered:
- Sets and set operations
- Dictionaries and key-value storage
- Case-insensitive input handling
- Frequency analysis of characters

### Week 8: Python Command-Line Utilities
Topics Covered
- sys.argv for command-line arguments
- File handling (open, read, write)
- Error handling(try/except)
- String manipulation and case-insensitive comparison
- Sets and dictionaries for data processing
- Standard library modules (string, shutil, statistics, urllib)

## Practicals

### 1. 00_introduction_to_github.ipynb: 
This introduces GitHub, creating an account, setting up authentication and emails, creating repositories, and making commits. Great for building your online programming portfolio and understanding GitHub basics.

### 2. 01_markdown.ipynb: 
This covers the basics of Markdown in Jupyter Notebooks, formatting text, headings, lists, links, and embedding images. Also explains how to manage notebooks and push them to GitHub.

### 3. 02_first_programs(1).ipynb:
This introduces basic Python programming concepts: input/output, variables, arithmetic operations, and f-strings. Includes practical exercises such as calculating squares, run rate, batting average, final grades, taxis required, and chocolate shop totals.

### 4. 03_more_first_programs(1).ipynb:
This Builds on the first programs with a focus on code style, variable naming, readability, and PEP-8 guidelines. Includes practical exercises like calculating pizza area, cost per square cm, differences in weights, fruit packing, and more. Also demonstrates how formatting tools like black can be used.

### 5. 04_making_tables.ipynb:
This introduces iteration (loops) in Python. Covers creating sequences, generating tables, converting units, drawing shapes (square, rectangle, triangle), interactive programs, and practicing abstraction by recognizing patterns in code.

### 6. 05_off_the_happy_path.ipynb:
This focuses on error handling and moving beyond the Happy Path. Covers conditional statements, input validation, exception handling (EAFP and LBYL), and real-world interactive programs such as unit conversion, sharing sweets, calculating averages, and computing change with optimal coins.
