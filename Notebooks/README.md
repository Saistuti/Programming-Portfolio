# Notebooks
This repository contains a collection of Python programs developed throughout Week 2, Week 3, Week 4, Week 5, Week 6, Week 7 and Week 8 of the Fundamentals of Computer Programming module.
The work demonstrates a progressive understanding of Python fundamentals, moving from basic input/output to functions, data structures, command-line arguments, and simple encryption techniques.

## Week 2 - Basic Input, Output and Conditionals
Topics Covered:
- User input with input()
- Formatted output
- Conditional statements (if, else)
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Simple validation logic

Example Programs:
- Greeting the user by name (handling empty input)
- Temperature conversion (Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit)
- Group and sweets distribution using integer division
- Basic password confirmation

## Week 3 - Loops, Validation, and Repetition
Topics Covered:
- for and while loops
- Input validation
- Repetition until valid input
- Multiplication tables

Example Programs:
- Password validation with length and matching rules
- Preventing common passwords
- Repeating input until a valid password is set
- Multiplication tables (fixed, user-defined, and reverse order)

## Week 4 - Functions, Strings, and Data Processing
Topics covered:
- Functions and return values
- String manipulation and formatting
- Input validation
- Lists, loops, and basic statistics

Example Programs:
- Validating marks (0-100)
- Counting uppercase and lowercase letters
- Formatting names
- Removing the last character from a string
- Temperature conversion and formatting
- Calculating max, min and mean from fixed or variable inputs

## Week 5: Command-Line Arguments and File Operations
Topics Covered:
- Using sys for command-line arguments and platform info
- URL requests and HTTP status checking
- Basic file operations and backups
- Lists, statistics, and data processing

Example Programs:
- Reporting the operating system platform
- Counting command-line arguments
- Finding the shortest command-line argument
- Checking if a website is reachable via URL
- Calculating max, min, and mean from command-line temperature inputs
- Creating a backup copy of a file

## Week 6: Number Thory and Simple Encryption
Topics Covered:
- Binary conversion
- Finding factors of a number
- Prime number checking
- Basic string encryption and decryption
- Randomization for message hiding

Example Programs
- Converting a positive integer to binary
- Finding all factors of a number
- Checking whether a number is prime
- Simple message encryption by removing spaces and reversing
- Hiding messages with random letters at fixed intervals
- Revealing messages encrypted with a fixed interval

## Week 7: Sets, Dictionaries, and Frequency Analysis
Topics Covered:
- Sets and set operations
- Dictionaries and key-value storage
- Case-insensitive input handling
- Frequency analysis of characters

Example Programs:
- Listing all unique letters in a string
- Comparing letters in two words (either, both, or only in one)
- Storing and retrieving countries and capitals
- Counting letter frequency and reporting the six most common letters

## Week 8: Python Command-Line Utilities
Topics Covered
- sys.argv for command-line arguments
- File handling (open, read, write)
- Error handling(try/except)
- String manipulation and case-insensitive comparison
- Sets and dictionaries for data processing
- Standard library modules (string, shutil, statistics, urllib)

Example Programs:
- Numbering lines in a file (nl.py)
- Comparing two files (diff.py)
- Searching for text in a file (grep.py)
- Counting lines and characters (wc.py)
- Simple spell checker (spell.py)
- Temperature statistics (temps.py)
- Password validation programs
- Encryption and decryption programs
