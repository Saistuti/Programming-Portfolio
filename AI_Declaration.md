# AI Declaration
I declare that Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools were used as a continuous learning support, functioning as a virtual tutor rather than a source of ready-made answers. The primary purpose of using AI was to assist my understanding, clarify dificult concepts, and provide guidance when I encountered few bugs. It also supported my learning helping me analyze errors, interpret questions more clearly, and strengthen my understanding of Python programming concepts when I felt uncertain. I am fully aware of the academic integrity policies and the consequences associated with academic misconduct. Therefore, AI was not used to copy or submit complete solutions mindlessly. 

## Uses of AI:
- For performing quick concept checks and clarification.
- For supporting problem analysis 
- For explanations of problem statements.
- For assisting with debugging and understanding errors.
